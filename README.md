# Anti-Air-Radar-Arduino-Project-Code
This project simulates a radar system using an Arduino, an ultrasonic sensor, and a servo motor. The servo sweeps the ultrasonic sensor from 15° to 165°, measuring distance to objects in real time. Data is sent over serial communication to a Processing sketch, which visualizes the radar sweep and displays detected objects.
